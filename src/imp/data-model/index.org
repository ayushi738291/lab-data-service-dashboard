* Introduction
  The application or the system is abstracted as the data model.  The model
  captures: the entities that comprise the system; relations and constraints
  between these entities; and operations that entail a change in the state of
  the system.

* Notation
  The system is defined as the data model.  There is a certain notation that is
  used defining the data model. 

** Sets, cardinality and relations

If =A= is a set, then
    1. =A!= denotes exactly one element of =A=.
    2. =A?= denotes at most one element of =A=.
    3. =A+= denotes  one or more elements of =A=
    4. =A*=  denotes at zero or more elements of =A=.  Often
       abbreviated as =A=.
    5. =A > B= denotes a relation /from/ =A= /to/ =B=.

** Relations and their cardinality type

A relation =r:A > B= could relate each element of =A= to
zero, one or more elements of =B=.

| Cardinality of B               | Notation  |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at least zero elements of =B=. | r: A > B  |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at most one element of =B=     | r: A > B? |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| at least one element of =B=    | r: A > B+ |   |   |
|--------------------------------+-----------+---+---|
| exactly one element of =B=     | r: A > B! |   |   |
